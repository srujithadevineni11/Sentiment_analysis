# Research Internship - Sentiment Analysis on Social Media

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my research internship module on sentiment analysis on social media. In this repository, you will find the code, report, and conference paper associated with this project.

## Overview

This research internship module focused on sentiment analysis and its application to social media data. Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in text data, which is particularly valuable for understanding public opinion and user feedback on various social media platforms.

### Project Goals

The primary objectives of this research internship were as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: In this project, we gathered relevant social media data from Twitter for sentiment analysis. The datasets used in this research were obtained from Kaggle. Below are the links to access these datasets:

   - [Twitter Sentiment Dataset by Saurabh Shahane](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/twitter-sentiment-dataset)
     - **Description**: This dataset contains Twitter data with sentiment labels, making it suitable for sentiment analysis tasks. It includes information about the text of the tweets and their associated sentiments.
   
   - [Twitter Sentiments EDA Dataset by Vignesh1694](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vignesh1694/eda-twitter-sentiments)
     - **Description**: This dataset is focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Twitter sentiments. It contains Twitter data, and it may be useful for understanding the distribution of sentiments in tweets.
   

   - [EDA for Sentiment Analysis Dataset by Abdokamr](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdokamr/eda-for-sentiment-analysis)
     - **Description**: This dataset is designed for exploratory data analysis (EDA) in the context of sentiment analysis. It provides Twitter data with sentiment labels and additional attributes for analysis.
   

These datasets collectively provide a valuable resource for conducting sentiment analysis on Twitter data. You can explore and analyze these datasets to gain insights into sentiment patterns on the platform and develop sentiment analysis models.



3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure it is suitable for analysis. This includes tasks such as tokenization, removing stopwords, and handling special characters.

4. **Sentiment Analysis Model**: Develop and implement a sentiment analysis model using machine learning techniques. 

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the sentiment analysis model using appropriate metrics and techniques. 

6. **Report and Paper**: In this research internship module, we have extensively documented our findings, methodology, and results in two comprehensive documents:
     - **Research Report**: [Research Report](https://github.com/srujithadevineni11/Sentiment_analysis/blob/main/Sentiment%20Analysis%20detailed%20report.docx%20(1).pdf)
 our research report provides an in-depth exploration of the entire project. It covers the background, objectives, data collection and preprocessing, sentiment analysis model development, evaluation metrics, and insightful conclusions. It serves as a comprehensive reference for understanding the research in detail.
     
     - **Conference Paper**: We had the privilege of presenting our research paper, "Predicting User Sentiments in Social Media with Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Techniques," at the MIR Labs Conference.Our conference paper provides a concise summary of our research presented at MIR Labs. It emphasizes key contributions and highlights in the field of sentiment analysis on social media. The paper offers valuable insights into our findings and their significance.
